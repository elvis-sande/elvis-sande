## Projects

### [BOOKYT INVESTMENTS](https://github.com/Bookyt)

*Co-Founder & Software Engineer | `2021- Ongoing`*

Bookyt is a startup founded by myself that deals with research in the fields of AI, cryptography and blockchain technology, and develops future-proof technical solutions enabling clients to achieve their goals without worries.

<details>
  <summary><b>Our ongoing R&D projects</b></summary>

* We are conducting research in developing a new, fast, cheap and efficient blockchain by using principles of blockchain to convert SQL databases into encrypted, tamper-proof ledgers
* We are developing a cryptocurrency exchange mobile application as a POC for the SQL blockchain (kind of like an online bank) to enable anyone mint their own fungible or non-fungible tokens by depositing money into the exchange, transfer tokens from any location/account/user to any other location/user/account on earth, and destroy/withdraw tokens, all for free, or worst case very cheap
* We are developing a digital contracts mobile application on top of the SQL blockchain as a POC to enable clients create digital, secure contracts of any kind, like title deeds, agreements, and so on
* We are working on a generalized state-of-the-art computer-vision and object detection AI model to deploy on devices that can be used for corporate or private use in a variety of use cases
* We have other projects on solar and wind energy, and using robots and IOT devices for 'smart farming'
